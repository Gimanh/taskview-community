# TaskView Source-Available License

Version 1.0 – Draft (tailored for TaskView)

---

## 1. Purpose

This license makes the TaskView source code available while:

* allowing individuals and teams (including family) to use it for their own work
* allowing companies to self-host and use it internally
* allowing forks, while protecting the TaskView name/branding
* explicitly prohibiting SaaS / managed hosting of TaskView for third parties
* explicitly prohibiting competing commercial products

---

## 2. Definitions

**“Software”** means TaskView, including source code, binaries, documentation, and related assets in this repository.

**“You”** means any individual or legal entity exercising permissions under this license.

**“Permitted Users”** means:

* for individuals: You and members of Your household/family; and
* for organizations: Your employees and contractors acting on Your behalf.
* Permitted Users do not include Your customers, end users, or any third parties who are not employees/contractors acting on Your behalf.

**“Organization”** means the legal entity You represent (if any).

**“Internal Use”** means use of the Software solely by Permitted Users for Your own personal or organizational purposes.

**“Managed Service”** means providing the Software (or a material portion of it) to third parties as a hosted service, SaaS, subscription access, or “service bureau” offering, whether paid or free.

For avoidance of doubt, Managed Service includes:
- “hosting or operating the Software for the benefit of a third party (e.g., a client), even if provided as part of consulting or IT services;”
- “providing third parties access to Your instance of the Software (accounts, workspaces, or shared projects), whether paid or free.”

**“Competing Product”** means any software or service whose primary purpose is project/task management or work tracking, that is offered to third parties (commercially or as a service), and that is reasonably substitutable for TaskView, including products targeting a specific vertical market (e.g., medical, legal, or industrial).

**“TaskView Marks”** means the names “TaskView”, associated logos, and other trademarks/branding owned by the licensor.

## 3. Grant of Rights

Subject to this license, You may:

* use the Software for Internal Use (personal, family, team, or internal company use)
* self-host and run the Software on Your own infrastructure
* modify the Software for Internal Use
* create forks and distribute the fork’s source code and/or binaries **only if** You comply with Section 4 (Branding) and do not violate Section 5 (Restrictions)

---

## 4. Branding and Forks (Trademarks)

1. This license **does not** grant any rights to the TaskView Marks.
2. If You distribute a fork (source or binaries), You must:
   * remove or replace all TaskView Marks (product name, logos, and similar branding)
   * avoid implying endorsement by, affiliation with, or origin from the TaskView project
3. You may describe Your fork as “based on TaskView” in documentation (nominative use) as long as it is clear it is an independent fork.

---

## 5. Restrictions (Explicitly Forbidden)

You may **not**:

1. Offer the Software, or any modified version or fork of it, as a **Managed Service**.
2. Use the Software (or any modified version or fork of it) to create, market, or operate a **Competing Product**.
3. Sell, license, or commercially distribute the Software (or any modified version or fork of it) to third parties as a product (standalone or bundled), except where a separate commercial license is obtained from the copyright holder.

For clarity, this restriction does not prohibit charging fees for installation, configuration, customization, training, support, or consulting services, provided that the Software is used only for Internal Use by Permitted Users and is not offered as a Managed Service.

4. Distribute a modified version or fork of the Software under license terms that are less restrictive than this License with respect to Managed Services and **Competing Products**. If You distribute a fork (source or binaries), You must do so under either:  
   - this License; or
   - other license terms that include prohibitions at least as strict as Sections 5.1 and 5.2.  
5. Use the TaskView Marks in the name, branding, domain, or marketing of a fork or derivative product (see also Section 4).
6. Sublicense the Software, except to the limited extent needed to distribute a fork that complies with Sections 4 and 5.
7. When You distribute the Software or a Fork, You must include a copy of this License and all copyright notices.
8. You may not grant recipients any rights to the Software beyond those expressly granted by this License.

## 6. Commercial Licensing

If You want to:

* offer TaskView as a hosted or managed service
* provide access to TaskView to third parties outside Permitted Users
* build or sell a competing product based on TaskView

You must obtain a separate commercial license from the copyright holder.
