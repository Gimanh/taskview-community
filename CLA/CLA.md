TASKVIEW CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)
Unified (Individual + Entity)
Version 1.0

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between:
(1) the TaskView project copyright holder / maintainer (“Licensor”), and
(2) the signatory identified in the Signature Block (“You”).

By submitting a Contribution to the Project, You agree to the terms of this Agreement.

1. Definitions
1.1 “Project” means the TaskView software, documentation, and related materials maintained by Licensor.
1.2 “Contribution” means any work of authorship (including code, documentation, designs, tests, examples, or other materials)
    that You intentionally submit for inclusion in the Project, unless explicitly marked in writing as “Not a Contribution”.
1.3 “Submit” means any communication to Licensor or the Project via source control, code review, issue trackers, or email.

2. Relationship to the Project License
Licensor distributes the Project under the “TaskView Source-Available License” (the “Project License”) as published in the
Project repository. This Agreement governs Contributions and ensures Licensor has the rights needed to maintain, modify,
distribute, and commercialize the Project. This Agreement does not limit any rights You may have under the Project License
for using the Project.

3. Ownership
You retain ownership of Your Contributions. This Agreement does not transfer ownership to Licensor.

4. Copyright License Grant
You grant to Licensor and Licensor’s successors and assigns a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to:
(a) use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, publish, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display
    Your Contributions, in whole or in part; and
(b) sublicense and authorize others to exercise the foregoing rights,
for any purpose, including incorporation into the Project and distribution as part of the Project or in separate works, in
source or object form.

5. Right to Relicense and Commercialize
You agree that Licensor may, at Licensor’s sole discretion, without any further permission, approval, or compensation:
(a) license, sublicense, distribute, and relicense the Project and Your Contributions (as incorporated into the Project)
    under any terms, including proprietary, commercial, dual-license, source-available, or open-source terms;
(b) offer commercial licenses, hosted offerings, enterprise terms, or licensing exceptions; and
(c) decide whether, when, and under what terms to release any version of the Project.

6. Patent License Grant
To the extent You have the right to grant it, You grant to Licensor and Licensor’s successors and assigns a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 6.2) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with
the Project.
6.2 If You initiate patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that the Project or a Contribution
infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted by You under this Agreement for that Project terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.

7. Moral Rights (to the extent permitted by law)
To the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert moral rights (including rights of integrity or
attribution) in Your Contributions against Licensor or recipients of the Project, to enable modification and commercialization
of the Project. If such waiver is not permitted, You agree not to exercise such rights in a way that interferes with the rights
granted under this Agreement.

8. Additional Terms for Entity (Company) Signing
This Section 8 applies only if You sign on behalf of a legal entity (“Entity”).
8.1 Authority. You represent that You are authorized to sign this Agreement on behalf of Entity.
8.2 Authorized Contributors. Entity authorizes its employees and contractors (“Authorized Contributors”) to submit Contributions
    on Entity’s behalf under this Agreement.
8.3 Identification. Upon request, Entity will provide Licensor a reasonable method to identify Authorized Contributors
    (e.g., list of GitHub usernames, email domain(s), or GitHub organization membership).
8.4 Entity Rights. Entity represents it has sufficient rights in Contributions submitted by its Authorized Contributors to grant
    the licenses in this Agreement.

9. Representations
You represent that:
9.1 You are legally entitled to grant the licenses in this Agreement (and if signing for an Entity, that you have authority).
9.2 Each Contribution is Your original work, or You have sufficient rights to submit it and grant these licenses.
9.3 If Your Contribution includes third-party material, You will identify it and the applicable license in the pull request
    description or other written notice.

10. No Warranty; No Support
Contributions are provided “AS IS”, without warranties of any kind. You are not required to provide support.

11. Miscellaneous
